            <h2>ACTIVITY HIGHLIGHTS   </h2>
            <p>Through our various interventions regarding prevention, protection, prosecution and rehabilitatio0n we strive towards providing a safe heaven for the victims of flesh trade by helping them rebuild their lives.

                <h2>COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION</h2>
                <p> We at Guria believe that to achieve sustainability for both the survivors and this movement against child trafficking and sexual exploitation, we need peoples’ ownership and participation at source, transit, and destination levels while dealing with the issue of slavery. To ensure this, we use various tools to reach people, including village meetings, availing government entitlements at vulnerable source areas, awareness campaigns through street plays and folk songs, foot and cycle marches to spread an understanding of human trafficking into the vulnerable families and communities. Such actions together convert into strong disciplined womens’ groups/vigilance committees which take self ownership and leadership to prevent further trafficking.

            <div class="thirdPara">
                <h2>CAMPAIGN IN SCHOOLS</h2>
                <p> Children, being the youngest section of the society, are easiest to mould and make the best messengers of social issues. By making the children aware, we also create awareness in their families and neighbours about the trafficking and exploitation. This is done through organizing various competitions like painting, essay writing and quiz competitions.</p>

                    RESCUE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the priorities of the organization is to rescue women and children from being trafficked for sex and labour. Over the years, Guria has successfully rescued more than 2000 people from the clutches of slavery.

            <div class="fifthPara">
                <h2>LEGAL INTERVENTION</h2>
                <p> Guria as an NGO that is dedicated towards prevention of human trafficking realises that merely carrying out rescue operations or charity work for the victims will not be effective in combating human trafficking. Guria has taken legal action thereby breaking up the criminal nexus through bail rejections of traffickers, victim/witness protection, mock trials, opposing custody of victims, brothel seizures, and convictions, etc. It is only legal intervention that will ensure the logical conclusion of our holistic approach, ensure a proper deterrence and set a precedent within society.

                <p>
                    Guria has garnered support from the national agencies on human rights like National Human Rights Commision, National Commission for Women, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights in the cases related to sex trafficking, child prostitution and rape.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Guria also launched a worlwide campaign against human trafficking titled “Freedom Now” (freedomnowcampaign.org), organized cultural events by marginalized folk artists and also shows its potential by organizing sensitization meetings of over 25,000 women every year against the rising crimes of child prostitution, rape and sex trafficking.

                    In order to prevent second generation prostitution, Guria works towards providing basic literacy to the children of the red light areas in and around Varanasi, along with meals. In these centres a lot of post traumatic therapy is conducted to help the kids rise above their painful past through various forms of art, music and dance. Across 4 educational centres, Guria is supporting over 350 children.

                    An important concern for the women in the red light areas is health care since their bodies are treated as commodities. Guria also provides emergency health support to women from the red light area and facilitates referral services by escorting them to the nearest government hospital and providing them the financial support for the treatment. We also ensure these women continue to access the government health services.
