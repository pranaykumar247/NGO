                A FEW FACTS ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING:
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>According to a 2016 estimate by the Global Slavery Index, there are 45.8 million individuals
                    involved in
                    some form of modern slavery. Out of these, more than 18 million (highest in the world) people are
                    living in
                    conditions of modern slavery in India (Global Slavery Index 2016)</li>
                <li>Globally, human trafficking is the second largest - and fastest growing - criminal industry in the
                    world.
                    (Polaris Project)</li>
                <li>800,000 people, 80% women, are trafficked internationally every year. (The 2014 U.S. TIP Report)
                </li>
                <li>Over 4.5 million individuals worldwide are victims of forced commercial sexual exploitation. (ILO
                    Report,
                    2014)</li>
                <li> Human trafficking earns profits of roughly $150 billion a year for traffickers. $99 billion of that
                    is from
                    commercial sexual exploitation. (ILO Report, 2014)</li>
                <li>According to the 2015 State Department Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, there were only 10,051
                    prosecutions and 4,443 convictions for trafficking globally in 2014. (The 2014 U.S. TIP Report)</li>
                <li>75% to 77% victims enter the sex trade through trafficking (Report: Girls and women in prostitution
                    in
                    India, Supported by Department of Women and Child Development, Govt. Of India)

            <p>We at Guria believe that to achieve sustainability for both the survivors and this movement against
                child trafficking and sexual exploitation, we need peoples’ ownership and participation at source,
                transit, </p>
            <p class="read">and destination levels while dealing with the issue of slavery. To
                ensure this, we use various tools
                to reach people, including village meetings, availing government entitlements at vulnerable
                source
                areas, awareness campaigns through street plays and folk songs, foot and cycle marches to spread
                an
                understanding of human trafficking into the vulnerable families and communities. Such actions
                together convert into strong disciplined womens’ groups/vigilance committees which take self
                ownership and leadership to prevent further trafficking</p>

            <p>Guria as an NGO that is dedicated towards prevention of human trafficking realises that merely
                carrying out rescue operations or charity work for the victims will not be effective in combating
                human trafficking.</p>

            <p class="read">
                Guria has taken legal action thereby breaking up the criminal nexus through bail rejections of
                traffickers, victim/witness protection, mock trials, opposing custody of victims, brothel
                seizures, and convictions, etc. It is only legal intervention that will ensure the logical
                conclusion of our holistic approach, ensure a proper deterrence and set a precedent within
                society.
